            <main>This part of the website is before the next part, even though I made the next
                 part first.  Therefore, the orientation presented here does not represent the flow of time
                  in which it was created.

                I'm at a cafe glancing up at the wet streets outside, enjoying doing homework
                 way more than I am going to enjoy going to work in a half-hour.
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                Until then, I'll do my best to enjoy the sensation of learning and practicing.  
                The coffee isn't that great here, but it's just drip, so who know's probably should have gotten and Americano. 
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                South park is an interesting neighborhood, interesting hearing NPR stories about how 
                locals are getting priced out, just like everywhere else, but it does seem to have a uniquely non-white vibe, that feels sad to lose.
